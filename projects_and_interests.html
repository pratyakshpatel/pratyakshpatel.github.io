      <h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781136">Isolation Forest</a></h3>

      </p>We've all learnt and implemented random forest, its one of the first algorithms we learn while learning ML. Most of the times, we strive to find patterns using these algorithms, another paradigm that exists is that of anomaly detection; learning about it is how I came across Isolation Forests.
       In this project, I wrote a full isolation forest algorithm from first principles using numpy. The model constructs multiple binary trees by recursively partitioning randomly subsampled data, isolating anomalies with shorter path lengths. I applied this on synthetically generated 2d data (normal distribution + uniform outliers), computed anomaly scores based on average path length, and visualized the detection results with a threshold-based classification.

      </p>Implemented the GSA on the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12046-024-02578-w">Heterogeneous truck fleet optimization</a> problem. I learnt about evolutionary algorithms in my AI course in my sixth semester, ever since I wanted to explore other nature inspired algorithms, I came across GSA and implemented it on the truck fleet optimisation problem.
          I will try implementing more metaheuristics which are nature inspired, preferably on the same problem setup.

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>My primary interests are machine learning, ever since I took the course. I also share a similar fondness for statistical NLP. 
        Recently, I have been reading a lot on vision problems, image-to-text models and their intricacies. But something that has caught 
        my attention heavily is operations research and decision sciences, especially with a ML/DL outlook. I wish to explore that even 
        more and also share some of it through my <a href="technical_blog.html">technical blog</a> as I find time.
