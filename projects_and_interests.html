    <h2>From Scratch</h2>
    
    <h3>Transformer</h3>
    <p>August 2025 |
      <a href="https://github.com/pratyakshpatel/From-Scratch/tree/main/TRANSFOMER" target="_blank">Project Link</a>
    </p>
    <p> 
I implemented a Transformer model completely from scratch using only NumPy, covering key components like multi-head self-attention, feedforward layers, and positional embeddings. The model stacks multiple Transformer blocks with residual connections and layer normalization. Finally, it projects outputs through a language modeling head, enabling sequence-to-sequence predictions.
I am planning to implement more complex architectures from scratch in coming times.
    </p>
    

    
    
    <h3>ARIMA</h3>
    <p>August 2025 |
      <a href="https://github.com/pratyakshpatel/From-Scratch/tree/main/ARIMA" target="_blank">Project Link</a>
    </p>
    <p> 
This implementation builds an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model entirely from scratch using only numpy. 
It avoids high-level libraries like statsmodels, making every step transparent: differencing for stationarity, 
manual AR and MA term calculations, and likelihood-based parameter estimation.

    <h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781136" target="_blank">Isolation Forest</a></h3>
    <p>July 2025 |
      <a href="https://github.com/pratyakshpatel/Paper-Implementations/tree/main/Isolation%20Forest" target="_blank">Project Link</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've all learnt and implemented random forest; it's one of the first algorithms we encounter in ML. Most of the time, we strive to find patterns using such algorithms. Another paradigm is anomaly detection — and that’s how I came across Isolation Forests.
      In this project, I wrote the full Isolation Forest algorithm from scratch using NumPy. The model builds binary trees by recursively splitting randomly sampled data to isolate outliers quickly. I used synthetic 2D data (normal + uniform noise), calculated anomaly scores based on average path lengths, and visualized the decision boundaries.

    <p>
      Implemented GSA on the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12046-024-02578-w" target="_blank">Heterogeneous Truck Fleet Optimization</a> problem. Inspired by evolutionary algorithms introduced in my AI course, I explored GSA — a nature-inspired metaheuristic. I implemented it on the same truck fleet problem to compare its effectiveness with genetic algorithms and MIP.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My primary interest lies in machine learning, especially after taking a core ML course. I also enjoy statistical NLP and am currently reading more about image-to-text systems and VLMs. Lately, I’ve grown fond of operations research and decision sciences, especially at their intersection with ML/AI. I have also recently developed an interest in graph machine learning and sports analytics as well. I hope to write more on these ideas in my <a href="technical_blog.html">technical blog</a> as I go deeper.
