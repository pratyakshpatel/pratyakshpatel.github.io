    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>Like others, I wasn't blessed with any artistic talent like singing, dancing, or music; however, I was lucky enough to discover that I do share some passion for writing — be it technical,
    or just letting my thoughts out on a piece of paper. I have been writing for the science magazine of IISERB, <em>Chrysalis</em>, for some time, and also run a <a href="https://markoveffect.blogspot.com/">blog</a>
    of my own, where I write about my life. I'm also planning to start a <a href="technical_blog.html">technical blog</a> and share some of the crazy stuff I come across in research papers or even random Reddit threads.</p>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>The passion for writing wasn't just a sudden occurrence — it was a consequence of my reading habit as a kid. Though I've never read fiction to date, I've read countless biographies and autobiographies.
    Lately, I've also developed a taste for history, especially modern history and war narratives.</p>

    <h2>Some Cool Threads</h2>
    <p>I spend a considerable time on Reddit and X (formerly Twitter), and here is a bunch of cool threads that I have come across.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1eamh7t/give_me_one_of_the_most_bizarre_jawdropping_most/">Give me one of the most bizarre jaw-dropping most insane fact you know about space.</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/16ysupv/what_physicists_and_mathematicians_biographies/">What Physicists and Mathematicians biographies can you recommend to me reading?</a></li>

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>Football is one of the most important parts of my life, and I am a proud supporter of Liverpool Football Club. I also <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/131660751?utm_source=android_share&utm_medium=social&share_sig=V5K03H441744528045&_branch_match_id=1290289353054506135&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXLy4pSixL1EssKNDLyczL1k81KzZP98vwLg9Osq8rSk1LLSrKzEuPTyrKLy9OLbJ1TUlPBQCMU%2FrnOwAAAA%3D%3D">run</a>
    a lot, thanks to the amazing roads of the IISERB campus.</p>
