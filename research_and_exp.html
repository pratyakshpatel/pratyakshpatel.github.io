      <h3>Expronto Technologies (Zeo Route Planner - YC W20) - July 2025</h3>
      <p>Working as a product development intern to develop and optimise a cool project they are working on.</p>


      <h3>IIM Nagpur – Summer of 2025</h3>
      <p>I came back here to work on yet another interesting problem, this time, both text and vision.</p>
      <p>Currently here working on feature extraction of social media data using computer vision and deep learning techniques.</p>

      <h3>IIM Nagpur – Summer of 2024</h3>
      <p>At the end of my second year, I had to make a choice between physics and data science as my major. I was very much inclined towards
        physics, but I also wanted to explore data science — but in a slightly different way. Dr. Kapil Kaushik from IIMN was generous enough to let me spend my summer with him and work on a cool NLP problem.</p>
