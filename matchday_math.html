<h1>The Predictability Problem in Football</h1>

<p>I wrote this originally for Chrysalis, the science magazine of IISERB, I am a big time football fan, and also love statistics.</p>
  
<p><em>"...the ultimate game of our planet"</em>, said Peter Drury. But is the unpredictability that makes it so, slipping away?</p>

<p>Football's appeal lies in its chaos — the miracle goals, the last-minute winners, the David vs Goliath moments. But just as cities gentrify, so do leagues. Top-tier clubs continue to dominate, not by accident, but through capital-driven talent accumulation. The more they win, the more money they earn, reinforcing dominance — and predictability.</p>

<h2>Quantifying the Edge: Home Advantage</h2>
<p>Consider Anfield, the fortress of Liverpool. Statistically, we define score gap as:</p>
<p>\[ x = \text{Home Score} - \text{Away Score} \]</p>
<p>With \( y = 1 \) if the home team wins, and \( y = 0 \) otherwise. A logistic regression can model win probability:</p>
<p>\[ P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\mu x + s}} \]</p>
<p>Here, \(\mu\) and \(s\) are learned from historical data using maximum likelihood or least squares methods.</p>

<h2>Betting Odds and Real Probability</h2>
<p>In betting markets, payouts \( h \) and \( a \) for home/away wins are designed so that:</p>
<p>\[ P_{\text{home}} + P_{\text{away}} < 1 \]</p>
<p>That leftover is the bookmaker's edge. The game isn't just unfair — it's quantifiably tilted.</p>

<h2>The Elo Approach</h2>
<p>Elo rating systems dynamically adjust team strength based on match outcomes. The expected score \( E_i \) before the match is:</p>
<p>\[ E_i = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(R_j - R_i)/400}} \]</p>
<p>After the match, update as:</p>
<p>\[ R_i' = R_i + K(s_i - E_i) \]</p>
<p>Here, \( s_i \) is the actual outcome (1 = win, 0 = loss), \( K \) controls update speed. A logistic fit to Elo difference then predicts outcomes just like before.</p>

<h2>Brier Score: Measuring Predictive Accuracy</h2>
<p>How good are our models? Enter the Brier score, which measures the mean squared error between predicted probability and actual outcome:</p>
<p>\[ BS = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (f_i - o_i)^2 \]</p>
<p>Where \( f_i \) is predicted probability and \( o_i \) is the actual result (0 or 1). Lower Brier scores indicate better predictive accuracy. In multi-class cases with \( r \) categories:</p>
<p>\[ BS = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{t} \sum_{j=1}^{r} (f_{ij} - E_{ij})^2 \]</p>
<p>For our binary case (home win or not), the equation simplifies. It quantifies how far off the model's probability was, on average, across all matches.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you've made it this far, you're either a stats nerd or a die-hard football fan — possibly both. We walked through the math that tries to capture football’s unpredictability. Yet, no model, no metric can fully explain Leicester City in 2016. That’s the beauty of the game.</p>
